# Admission-Prediction

## Project Overview :

The Admission Prediction Machine Learning project aims to create a predictive model assessing graduate program admission likelihood based on factors like GRE, TOEFL, university rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and research experience. Valuable for applicants and institutions, it empowers students to make informed application decisions and enhances fairness in the admission process. By optimizing resource allocation and promoting transparency, the project contributes to a more efficient, data-driven approach to higher education admissions.
